## Description ##
A PHP framework for rapidly creating classes that mirror MySQL tables. The Simpl framework comes with the basic functions to list, display and edit records from the database. With this framework a simple manager and front of a site can be created within a few minutes. An example database, manager and front end are included with the framework.

## Features ##
  * No make/PEAR/Root Access required
  * Database table abstraction
  * Automatically configured database functions (ie. GetInfo, GetList, Save, Delete, Search and Form)
  * Advanced automatic form creation to mirror database/class expectations, XHTML compliant and ADA accessible.
  * Table structure caching, Query level caching, and saving of inserts or updates to the filesystem if the database is unavailable.
  * Ability to query cross databases on the same server
  * Form validation
  * Upload, Move, Copy, Delete and List Files
  * Resize and Rotate Images
  * Email with class abstraction with support for attachments
  * RSS0.91, RSS1.0, RSS2.0, ATOM Feeds
  * CVS, JSON, XML and SQL Exports
  * JSON encoding and decoding support

## Goals ##
  * **Easy Install**. _No need to be an administrator._
  * **Minimal Server Load**. _Created for a high traffic shared server environment._
  * **Straightforward API**. _No need to dig through documentation, functions are naturally named._
  * **Stop Wasting Time**. _Time is precious, no need to reinvent the wheel._
